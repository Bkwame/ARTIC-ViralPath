# Viral Pipeline Analysis Project
A project based analysis using the Artic Fieldbioinformatics Pipeline for viral pathogen analysis.

## About the Artic Pipeline
artic is a pipeline and set of accompanying tools for working with viral nanopore sequencing data, generated from tiling amplicon schemes.

It is designed to help run the artic bioinformatics protocols; for example the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus protocol.

Features include:
* read filtering
* primer trimming
* amplicon coverage normalisation
* variant calling
* consensus building

There are 2 workflows baked into this pipeline, one which uses signal data (via nanopolish) and one that does not (via medaka).

## Installation
Guidance on the installation of the Pipeline can be found at the author's github page: https://github.com/artic-network/fieldbioinformatics

Documentation of the pipeline can be found at: http://artic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest
